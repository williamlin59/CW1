<h1>Installation notes</h1>
It is recommended to UNINSTALL any previous version of Java Modelling
Tools present on your PC before installing this new release.

<h2>Working folder</h2>
Since <b>JMT 0.9.0 version</b> the new concept of working folder was introduced.
<br>
The working folder is created in the home directory of the user to store the examples and for some working
files of JMT. Also the files created by the Loggers (xxx.csv files) are located in this folder. The location of the
JMT working folder depends on the operating system of the machine and the user name:
<ul>
	<li>on Linux and Unix os in general, the user home is located in path /home/<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>/JMT</li>
	<li>on Windows XP the working folder is C:\Documents and Settings\<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>\JMT</li>
	<li>on Windows Vista, Windows 7 and later the folder is C:\Users\<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>\JMT</li>
	<li>on Mac OS X the folder is /Users/<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>/JMT</li>
</ul>
In previous JMT versions, the default working folder was the JMT installation path. 
If you have stored some JMT models there, we suggest you to move them in the new working folder.

<h2>Be updated</h2>
New JMT versions will always be available, for free, at http://jmt.sourceforge.net
