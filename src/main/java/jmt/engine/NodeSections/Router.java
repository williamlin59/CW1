/**
 * This class implements a router, which routes the jobs according to the specified
 * routing strategies (one for each job class).
 * <br><br>
 * The class has different constructors to create a generic router or a blocking
 * region border queue, that is the router of a node which is inside a blocking
 * region and which sends jobs also to nodes outside the region.
 * When a job leaves the blocking region, the region input station must receive
 * a message, in order to serve the blocked jobs.
 * <br>
 * However it is also possible to create a generic router and then to turn on/off the
 * "border router" behaviour using the <tt>borderRouterTurnON(..)</tt> and
 * <tt>borderRouterTurnOFF()</tt> methods.
