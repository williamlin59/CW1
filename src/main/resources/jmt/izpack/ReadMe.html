<h1>Installation notes</h1>
It is recommended to UNINSTALL any previous version of Java Modelling
Tools present on your PC before installing this new release.

<h2>What's new in version 0.9.2</h2>
<h3>JMT</h3>
<ul>
<li>Project upgraded to Java 1.7</li>
<li>Upgraded installation to izPack 5.0 to support Windows 8.x</li>
<li>Default resolution upgraded to 1024x768</li>
<li>Code improvements: deep refactoring, added maven support, added unit tests</li>
</ul>
<h3>JMVA</h3>
<ul>  
<li>Users can now select any station in the model as Reference station (the station used for the computation of the system throughput and the system response time).</li>
<li>Code of MoM, CoMoM, and AMVA solution algorithms now part of the stable code branch</li>
</ul>
<h3>JSIM</h3>
<ul>
<li>New scheduling algorithms (shortest job first SJF, longest job first LJF, random RAND)</li>
<li>Class switch, new more powerful implementation, not available in this release for models with fork/join and finite capacity region</li>
<li>Support for using a large number of classes, queues, and finite capacity regions in a single model</li>
<li>Several statistics (mean, moments, ...) are generated for the performance indices (response time, number of customers, ...) with the possibility of generating graphics (histogram, density, distribution) on all or a part of the simulated events (results can be saved in CSV files)</li>
<li>New simulation control parameter, the simulation can be stopped at a user specified simulation time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working folder</h2>
Since <b>JMT 0.9.0 version</b> the new concept of working folder was introduced.
<br>
The working folder is created in the home directory of the user to store the examples and for some working
files of JMT. Also the files created by the Loggers (xxx.csv files) are located in this folder. The location of the
JMT working folder depends on the operating system of the machine and the user name:
<ul>
	<li>on Linux and Unix os in general, the user home is located in path /home/<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>/JMT</li>
	<li>on Windows XP the working folder is C:\Documents and Settings\<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>\JMT</li>
	<li>on Windows Vista, Windows 7 and later the folder is C:\Users\<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>\JMT</li>
	<li>on Mac OS X the folder is /Users/<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>/JMT</li>
</ul>
In previous JMT versions, the default working folder was the JMT installation path. 
If you have stored some JMT models there, we suggest you to move them in the new working folder.

<h2>Be updated</h2>
New JMT versions will always be available, for free, at http://jmt.sourceforge.net
